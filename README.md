# Express.js Unhandled Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which fails to handle database errors and cases where a requested user is not found. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to properly handle these scenarios to prevent unexpected application behavior.

## Problem

The original code lacks proper error handling for database operations and invalid user IDs. This can lead to:

* **Unexpected crashes:** If the database query fails, the application might crash without providing informative error messages.
* **Uninformative error messages:** Clients might receive generic error messages (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error), hindering debugging.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** Improper error handling might leak sensitive information.

## Solution

The improved code (`bugSolution.js`) addresses these issues by:

1. Handling database errors explicitly.
2. Checking for the existence of a user before processing.
3. Returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found) to indicate failures.
4. Providing more informative error messages to clients.
